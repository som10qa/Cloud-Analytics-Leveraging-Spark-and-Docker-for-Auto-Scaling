# Cloud-Based Data Analytics Platform with Auto-Scaling Using Apache Spark and Docker

## Project Overview

This project develops a cloud-based data analytics platform integrated with Apache Spark and Docker. It enables large-scale distributed data processing, auto-scaling, and efficient resource management. The platform handles large datasets by distributing computation across cloud nodes with dynamic resource scaling. It is fault-tolerant to guarantee continuity of operation upon node or container failures.

## Features

- Apache Spark for distributed data processing
- Docker containers for application deployment
- Docker Swarm for orchestration and auto-scaling
- MongoDB for data storage
- Fault tolerance with restart policies and health checks

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 20.10 or later
- Docker Compose 1.29 or later
- Internet connection to download images and dependencies

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
